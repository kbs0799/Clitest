# What is CliFin?

**CliFin** is a Python framework designed for assessing financial risks in a variety of investment assets in response to climate change. Addressing the technical limitations of conventional climate risk assessment methods, which often depend on hypothetical scenarios and spreadsheet models, CliFin enhances flexibility and extensibility. The framework comprises two primary components: ‘CliFin Core,’ an embedded Domain-Specific Language (DSL) that allows dynamic model adjustments without manual intervention, and a financial modeling component tailored to specific investment assets. CliFin Core’s DSL enables the integration of various risk factors and climate scenarios.
