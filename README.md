# CliFin
CliFin is a Python framework designed for assessing financial risks in a variety of investment assets in response to climate change. 
The framework is divided into three main parts. 
1. CliFin Core : Embedded domain-specific language (DSL) that allows you to dynamically adapt your model without manual manipulation.
2. CliFin infra : Performing cash flow projections, risk factor reflection, and asset valuation.
3. Datasets for various types of assets and climate scenario analysis to perform CliFin infra.
